In the run_analysis.R file:
1. Download dataset:
  - store the download link in fileUrlC3 
  - save the file with filename "C3-project.zip"

2. Load data
  - activities: 
    - load activity_labels.txt 
    - 6 rows, 2 columns
    - list of 6 activities 
  - features: 
    - load features.txt
    - 561 rows, 2 columns
    - list of all features/functions
  - subject_test:
    - load test/subject_test.txt 
    - 2947 rows, 1 column
    - list of 9 out of 30 voluteers 
  - subject_train: 
    - load train/subject_train.txt 
    - 7352 rows, 1 column
    - list of 21 out of 30 voluteers
  - x_test: 
    - load test/x_train.txt
    - 2947 rows, 561 columns
    - list of features of test data
  - y_test: 
    - load test/y_train.txt
    - 2947 rows, 1 columns
    - list of activity code of test data
  - x_train: 
    - load train/x_train.txt
    - 7352 rows, 561 columns
    - list of features of train data
  - y_train:  
    - load train/y_train.txt
    - 7352 rows, 1 columns
    - list of activity code of train data

3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - merge x_test and x_train and save into xdata, 10299 rows, 561 columns
  - merge y_test and y_train and save into ydata, 10299 rows, 561 columns
  - merge subject_test and subject_train and save into suject data, 10299 rows, 1 column
  - merge xdata, ydata and subject data and all save into mergedData, 10299 rows, 563 column

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  - select subject, code and column name contains either "mean" or "std" words and save into extractedData, 10299 rows, 88 columns

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  - join activities with extractedData by code and replace the extractedData, 10299 rows, 89 columns

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - code column renamed to activityCode
  - replace t character at the beginning of all column names with Time
  - replace f character at the beginning of all column names with Frequency
  - replace Acc in all column names with Accelerometer
  - replace Gyro in all column names with Gyroscope
  - replace Mag in all column names with Magnitude
  - replace BodyBody in all column names with Body
  - replace gravity in all column names with Gravity
  - replace angle in all column names with Angle
  - replace tBody in all column names with TimeBody

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  - group extractedData by subject, activity code and activity and calculate the average number for each variable and save into finalData, 180 rows and 89 columns
  - export finalData into finalData.txt file
